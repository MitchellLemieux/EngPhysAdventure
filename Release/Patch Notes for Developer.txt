--Alpha 0.29 Update- Developer Update - July 3, 2019
#First Kipling release and 1 year birthday! New features coming soon
ADDED Made a new string pareser mod that is adaptable, checks for overages, and can control delay called printT (see documentation or examples) [Text now prints better!]
ADDED Made items, people, interactables, and places all have different symbols around them
	* [People], ~Places~, <Things>, /Interactables/
ADDED Made an exploratory map for where you've traveled, and where you are
	* Made it in the orientation of front but could be changed
	* For each map object added a mapped attribute so you can explore
		(which in object definition is default to 0 to save changing the startup file)
	* Each spot will be - until it has been in your explore site radius, even though you haven't visted it
	* No big map or map options made yet
ADDED Code Conventions to Follow [Better coding practices and documentation!]
	* Made a good convention that if the function is over 40 lines, definetly by 50 then move it to it's own file
	* Also following the PP8 convention style guide for some but need to redo the game at one point
		* camel case for variables outside function ex) dogNose
		* lowercase for variables inside function (PP8)
		* lowercase with _ for functions/methods ex) nose_colour
		* Pascal case (letter of first words capatalized) for classes and objects ex) DogMan
	* Try to commit one commit all day, or when a major stuff is done
ADDED Added a notepad for how to install from PIP and added Playsound to the files so you don't have to install it
CHANGE New Dev and Release folders to seperate the game files, dev files, and files for exe release
CHANGE Added CSVs to the ignore file
CHANGE Removed Interact list storage from Map class because it actually was not being used
ADDED I partially added a CSV functionality. Can export entities to CSV and can write item code but not read in or do anything else [Better item/people development]
    * Partially did this because if my plans go through a lot of things will be changed in the code restructuring and this code will need to be changed anyways
    * Other part was I did not want to write this much backend code at the time when so little is being developed
ADDED Made for speedrun it turns off the text delay in printT
ADDED Made the game write the log file as well as save when ever it crashes
BUGFIX Fixed some typos

CHANGED Made Tyler Kashak Ridiculous [Added a new player]
CHANGED Structure of the game and made start and end functions in the main file so the game could be non-linearly played
