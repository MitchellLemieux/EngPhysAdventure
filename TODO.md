--fixes--
Dr. Haugen still walking around after he dies (remove him)
BIg hits doesn't kill anyone
Fix the map (doesn't show layout right as bsb is bellow JHE)


--current update features--
safe files for infinite laptop loop
	will it just be at locations 
	or be able to save whenever you want with a command?
encrypt safe file/logfile
document
release 0.27
make the load outside the function
Make the infinite nest!
encrypt and decrypt save file?
Realease 0.27

have that speed run time, steps, and other data saved to a stat file [encrypted] to be sent in and put on the leaderboard
	

Add leaderboard in the QT
add try and except that if there is a bug it exits safely with a display and saves your file
restart or exit command once the game ends (or keep playing if done the story)
	maybe using saves?
Have the text scroll by first time? And Also auto limit text display to roll over at 72 characters (no need to \n it).
	Also can we change it from 72 characters? Why is it that length? Why not 80? 100? Custom?
	Command prompt will rollover text automatically if too long
1 crazy idea feature

--0.27 Update - 
Made so you can't get to Okon's stash until you do the quest (may disable with
Added 2nd floor hatch
diaolog for Dan Fitz
Updated the 2nd floors so you can walk between them
Fixed the Time display program (was broken for hours)
Tryed to start making a load from log file but made infinite loops (make load from log once you have a debug file to do)
save and load files as a developer
fixed the key errors which broke the game and made it uplayable
Changed name of map class Remove to removeItem to be more clear and fit camelcase
Commented a lot of code and learned how it works, still not sure why it does though
Made a Creative mode function for creative mode functions (this should be changed)
Made you die if you're Mitch or Erik and eat penut butter
Added Haugen's clothes (once he disapears, fixed that as well), added epipen (which prevents you from dying)
Added max health and base stats (which adds to stats regardless of equipment) and are modifyable
Made the health qualifyier 0 or empty for it to not be food so you can heal or detrement as much as you want
SO I HAD TO CHANGE ALL THE EQUIPMENT ITEMS TO "". Actually it was fine cause idle has a find and replace function.
Made Tyler Kashak Rediculous
