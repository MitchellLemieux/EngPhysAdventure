**Installing Modules/Packages using PIP**

Some development packages for EBTA are not installed by default for Python 2.7.
We can use PIP, which does come isntalled by default, to install these from the command line or download from the internet and install.

Lets use an example to illustrate:
Say you need to instal Playsound.
Open your command prompt and type:
pip install Playsounds
And pip should automatically install it.

You can also search for the playsounds package on google and then downloaded it.
To install from a download use:
pip install C:\Users\bfallon\Downloads\playsound-1.2.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl
Where the filepath is to the downloaded file

The package will be installed to this location by default
C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages

If you have any problem it may be because PIP is installing the package to the wrong location or version of Python.
Try copying the files to the default location C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages.
If that doesn't work try searching up the issue as many people have done this before

For some simple packages we may just put them into the EBTA files because they're so small
